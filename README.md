# RC-Glow-Plug-Controller
A program that measures the length of RC pulses and turns on a glow plug for 15 seconds each time a button on the RC transmitter is pushed.

This program was written for a customer who races model speed boats as a hobby.
The issue he had was that at the start of the race he needs to turn on a glow plug. To do that he uses an of the shelve RC switch.
The problem is that frequently in the heat of the race he forgot to turn of the glow plug resulting in a broken glow plug.
The solution is to use an RC switch that turns the glow plug on each time a button on the RC transmitter is pushed but to turn the glow plug off after 15 seconds even if the button is still on.
